Please, don't create tickets on github for support. Instead, you can either:
- visit the community support on libera.chat #filestash. A searchable archive is available at https://support.filestash.app If you don't already have an IRC client, you can try this link: https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/#irc://irc.libera.chat/#filestash?nick=guest??
- register for enterprise support at https://www.filestash.app/pricing/#support
